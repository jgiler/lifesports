#### Steps I took to create this app

1. Completed the API endpoints in the LifeSports Express server. All MongoDB functions use mongoose data model.

2. Refactored this code to work with my MongoDB Atlas database. Updated my .env file so that you can use either mongodb locally on on Atlas

3. Deployed the app to Heroku

<!-- #### Hackathon Challenge

1. Use the working version of your LifeSports app from the Challenge to go the next level!
